                    <h3 id="about">About the Game</h3>
                      <p>Action Taimanin is a mix between Hack and Slash and Gacha. 
                        Similar in some ways to games such as Honkai Impact, premium currency in this game is 
                        split between buying characters and rolling gacha. Gacha has two aspects to it, weapons and supporters. 
                        Supporters can have powerful abilities that help in gameplay while weapons are character specific. 
                        You get to choose one of three starting characters for free, and the game is quite F2P friendly.</p>

                    <h3 id="starting_character">Picking Your Starting Character</h3>
                    <img src="assets/beginner_guide/beginner_characters.png" alt="Beginner Choices">
                         <p>The first thing you need to do is pick one of the starting characters: <a href="#asagi">Asagi</a>, <a href="#sakura">Sakura</a>, or <a href="#yukikaze">Yukikaze</a>. 
                        The one you pick really does not matter, Yukikaze and Sakura both have easy builds that don’t rely on supporters, 
                        Sakura using three blue and Yuki using three green, 
                        while Asagi has Koujinka as her gimmick which can let you cheese some missions.</p>
                        <h4 id="asagi">Asagi</h4>
                        <img src="assets/beginner_guide/asagi_description.png" alt="Asagi">
                            <p>Her main gimmick is Koujinka, think of Witch Time or The World, it slows down all enemies and lets you attack them at regular speed while they are drastically slowed.
                                This also synergizes with slow effects, Koujinka stacked with a slow effect will just freeze enemies. 
                                With the right build, you can easily have 100% Koujinka uptime. 
                                Her common builds are 2 red (making use of Koujinka and basic attacks) or 3 green (Renjinka skill build).</p>
                        <h4 id="sakura">Sakura</h4>
                        <img src="assets/beginner_guide/sakura_description.png" alt="Sakura">
                            <p>A dual daggers user. She has a very quick but short-range basic combo. Her main gimmick is snaring enemies.
                              Her best build is a full blue build which makes use of her spin attack, Shadow Cleave, which automatically teleports you to enemies.</p>
                        <h4 id="yukikaze">Yukikaze</h4>
                        <img src="assets/beginner_guide/yukikaze_description.png" alt="Yukikaze">
                            <p>One of two ranged characters, being ranged she is able to cheese harder content by kiting enemies while slowly chipping away at their health. 
                            Her best build is triple green which takes advantage of Raijuudan to deal massive AoE damage, Raiun for AoE damage + healing, 
                            and Hiraiten to stun enemies without super armor.</p>
                <h2 id = "post_tutorial"><u>Post Tutorial</u></h2>                
                <img src="assets/beginner_guide/app_homescreen.png" alt="Home">
                <p>You’ve finished the tutorial, now what?

                    The first priority is to clear up to Easy Chapter 5 to unlock Special Mode, Time Attack, and Event. Once you finish Chapter 5, finishing up the current event is the priority. While grinding event, you can hit Rank 20 to unlock Arena which is a good source of gems.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Things to keep in mind: At rank 5 you’ll receive a Bathrobe Voucher for one of the three starting characters. The costume just provides a minor buff to the character, so your choice doesn’t really matter.</p>
                    <img src="assets/beginner_guide/bathrobe_voucher.png" width = 30% alt="Bathrobe Voucher">
                <h3 id="first_ur">Picking Your First UR</h3>
                <p>At commander rank 10, you will receive a ticket that lets you pick one of three URs. 
                    <a href="#fuuma_amane">Fuuma Amane</a>, <a href="#major">Major</a>, or <a href="#tekkain_kaworu">Tekkain Kaworu</a>. We recommend that you hold off on using this ticket until you have done a few gacha rolls, as you may get duplicates otherwise. 
                    As the regular UR pool increases, this becomes less likely and the advice applies less.</p>

                <h2 id="events">Events</h2>
                <p>There are two types of events in this game, box events and store events.</p>
                <h3 id="box_event">Box Events</h3>
                <p>You have two main goals for box events. Clear out all nine boxes to get 5 copies of the free UR supporter or weapon that is featured and to clear all stages to get a total of 150 gems. Note: never fuse UR supporters or use weapon tickets immediately unless you have an extremely good reason.
                    <br><br>
                    After getting the UR supporter or Gacha Coin for a box, you can immediately skip ahead to the next box.<br>
                    <img src="assets/beginner_guide/gacha_coin_box.png" alt = "Gacha Coin">
                    <img src="assets/beginner_guide/ur_box.png" alt = "UR Box">
                    
                    <br><br>
                    It’s recommended that you go for Gems and AP Potions on at least the last three boxes, so 7, 8, 9.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    For farming tickets, Hard 5 gives the best Ticket to Energy ratio, but if it takes too long to clear, Normal 5 may be faster to clear and it’s not a significant difference. 3/4 vs 5/6 efficiency for Hard vs. Normal so only a .083 difference.</p>
                <h3 id="store_event">Store Events</h3>
                <p>
                    Store events are different from box events in that you get a currency from clearing any mission that you can spend in the store. <br>
                    <img src="assets/beginner_guide/event_shop.png" alt = "Event Shop"><br>
                    The most efficient method to clearing store events is to farm the discounted easy daily quest. More information on calculations can be found below.

                <p>The best place to farm for materials is Daily Quest Hard, but there is a caveat, if you can’t do Hard for gold farming, Easy is more efficient than Normal. You should only farm the daily material that is Half-Off. If there are multiple half-off missions, Gold is usually the priority since it is used in upgrading literally everything, next are beads/modules. For farming Core Module (Low) Chapter 1 Section 3 is the best.</p>

                <p>For dispatch, you want to unlock all of them except for the last one, which costs gems. You can wait until you have a decent amount of UR supporters from events since all dispatch missions require at least one UR Supporter.</p>

                <h3 id = "facilities">Facilities</h3>
                <p>First, you want to unlock all Facilities to level one. After that, you want to get the Crafting Facility to Level 4 to produce material for upgrading other facilities as well as limit breaking Taimanin to 70/75. Next upgrade the weapon facility to level two so you can upgrade two weapons at once. Upgrading random R and SR weapons is a good way of farming supporter intimacy for gems. Then alternate between EXP and Skill training facilities until maximum. Finally, you can upgrade the Crafting Facility to level 5 to make materials for Friend Point Costumes.</p>
