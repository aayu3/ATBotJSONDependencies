<p>Su is a very technical but also versatile character to play. She’s the only character in the game with a unique dodge mechanic and ultimate.<br>
Her dodges don’t reset the position of her normal combo whenever she dodges allowing you to stay mobile and pick up after your last used attack in your normal combo.  Instead of being a massive full screen nuke, her ultimate gives her of invulnerability and changes her move list while being unable to use her skills for 10 seconds. Both unique mechanics give Su a very unorthodox play style that a lot of people have came to enjoy.</p>

<h3 id="nakuryuusou">Nakuryuusou</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tYyMfsl.png" alt="Nakuryuusou">A very strong aoe attack that has a bit of a learning curve to fully master. Su jumps into the air in front of her and smashes everything below for massive damage. Learning the correct distance to use the skill to get maximum damage takes a while to get used to but this skill alone gives Su a very strong Green build.</p>
<h3 id="senrenka">Senrenka</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JUTxw9d.png" alt="Senrenka">One of Su’s best skills simply due to the “free” damage you get from it while she teleports around hitting every enemy. She teleports to 2 random enemies and hits them for pretty decent damage. If there is only one enemy remaining then both hits will go to the same target. Exceptionally good with a blue main for the 2 extra attacks but the skill is good with any build until you get to 81 and unlock Kokuryuha and the only reason why is because they both share the same input.</p>
<h3 id="shunrenka">Shunrenka</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aeKta4q.png" alt="Shunrenka">Overall not a very good skill due to the nature of it rooting you into the ground. Skills that root you into the ground will typically get you killed in harder content since you can’t afford to take any kind of damage. These skills are really only viable if you have supports like Spica or Yuno for the invulnerability effect.</p>
<h3 id="ryuuhashin">Ryuuhashin</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Vi3GohA.png" alt="Ryuuhashin">This is Su’s best damage option she has by a large margin. Su does a massive melee aoe that hurts everything around her except enemies directly behind her that ends with her shooting a big projectile directly out in front of her. The best thing about this skill is that you can just use it in the middle of your combo whenever you want to create your own finisher. The aoe capabilities of it are quite devastating even though it has a dead spot directly behind her.</p>
<h3 id="shoujinkyaku">Shoujinkyaku</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RKyxFPh.png" alt="Shoujinkyaku">A pretty interesting skill if you want quick short range aoe for high damage. The timing on activating this skill can be kind of difficult at first since it very frame specific but the damage payoff is worth it. The only downside of the attack is that you NEED to be attacked to be able to activate it. I have discovered that using Amane as your main support has a very nice synergy with this skill since her main ability does aoe counter damage on hit automatically for you. But the big thing about using Amane as your main support with this skill is that it makes the window of activation very easy to do. This ends up resulting with you doing two massive aoe hits in quick succession for very high damage. The only downside of this is that if you use super armor with Su then Amane’s main ability does not activate so I would only recommend using this skill with a green or blue build if you want to get the most out of it.</p>
<h3 id="shinryuuga">Shinryuuga</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4prz6Wu.png" alt="Shinryuuga">This is your typical dodge attack skill dishes out quick single target damage. If enemies are grouped up close enough it can sometimes hit multiple targets but it’s primarily a single target attack. Nothing exceptional about this skill but it is still useful if it fits your play style. The 2 blue for the extra hit was my favorite whenever I used this skill.</p>
<h3 id="ryuurinkou">Ryuurinkou</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fCBRbeL.png" alt="Ryuurinkou">A dodge counter skill that gives you super armor. Not exceptionally useful unless you are doing a super armor build that gives you some kind of benefit with it up. The main issue with super armor is that you still take full damage with it up so you are basically just expecting to constantly trade blows and see your health bar slowly deplete. You can go 3 blue to get 35% less damage taken but this skill is not worth slotting for most content.</p>
<h3 id="taimanin-art-blaze-dance">Taimanin Art: Blaze Dance</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WDTAD9Y.png" alt="Taimanin Art: Blaze Dance">Taimanin Art passives overall are very useful for nearly every character and it’s no exception for Su. This Taimanin Art changes her combo giving her new moves that are not present in the normal one. Overall is it was stronger and looks way cooler as well. Su can really take advantage of the full potential of her full combo due to her dodge mechanic that doesn’t reset her combo position whenever she dodges. There’s a neat trick where you can buffer your combo up to your final 3 hits then dodge to save your position before the next wave to open up with your strongest hitting attacks.</p>
<h3 id="seppashou">Seppashou</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7nm8y37.png" alt="Seppashou">A very unique skill that is only usable under very specific situations. You can only activate it after the final hit on your normal combo or certain skills. The usefulness of the skill is entirely dependent on how low cooldown your skills are for the most part. It can be a neat follow up skill to use but in the long run it’s not all that effective since it requires a skill slot to use.</p>
<h3 id="kokuryuha">Kokuryuha</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kZW6vOE.png" alt="Kokuryuha">Su’s “ultimate” skill she unlocks at level 81. It’s a very deadly attack that can easily clear entire waves on it’s own on some hard difficulty content. The more enemies the better with this kind of skill since the projectiles bounce between all of the enemies.  It’s very easy to drop Senrenka and use Kokuryuha over it because of how much better the skill is. A quirk with this skill is that you can cancel out of it too early and not get every projectile to come out, so if you want max damage you have to let the entire animation play out. Overall this is a very good level 81 skill compared to other characters. It should fill a slot in any kind of color build because of how devastating it is. The best effects are  2green or 2 blue for more damage.</p>
<h1 id="builds">Builds</h1>
<p>Su has a good variety of builds with most of her skills being fairly useful. This guide will only discuss pve builds with Su since she is mostly worthless for pvp anyway.</p>
<h2 id="brawling-nuker">Brawling Nuker</h2>
<p><strong>B/B/B</strong><br>
This is probably Su’s best build for general content. You don’t have to worry too much about setting up big AoE attacks, just get in deep with the enemy with your normal combo and use Ryuuhashin as a big attack or as a combo finisher.  Senrenka is an effective ability to instantly teleport to distant enemies or new waves that spawn getting you right back into fighting with little downtime of running around.</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-melee">Hybrid Melee</h2>
<p>This skill is similar to the previous one, the difference if that you are just taking more raw damage over crit damage for the 3 blue effect of Ryuuhashin. This will make your normal combo and other skills more powerful giving you easier daily clears.<br>

<p><strong>G/G/G</strong><br>
This build is a little trickier to use since Nakuryuusou is harder to aim up big big damage compared to Ryuuhashin. Once you get used to the range and perfect killzone it’s a very fun alternative to play.</p>

<h2 id="su-ultimate-spam">Su Ultimate Spam</h2>
<p>This is a very specific build aimed at generating high amounts of particles on hit allowing Su to activate her ultimate as many times as possible giving her a large uptime of invulnerability. This has helped many people clear difficult tower floors since you can chain her ultimate quite frequently. You generate particles as you attack in her ultimate form as well so when you leave her form you typically only need to use one Kokuryuha to fill your bar for another ultimate.  Some of these Supports and weapons are no longer obtainable in game unless there are reruns. Regardless, this build is worth including here due to the unique nature of her ultimate and it has helped many people clear the more difficult tower floors.</p>
<h3 id="skills-4">Skills</h3>

<li>Senrenka (Kokuryuha if 81)</li>

<p><strong>Optional choices in no particular order would be</strong></p>

<li>[Sub] Nanase Mai [SR]</li>
<li>[Sub] Ginryu Mitsue [R]</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see there is a lot of alternatives for this build. Ingrid and Futaba Yui are the only 2 required because of their extra particles on hit passives they have. Your 3rd support can be whatever and should mostly be setup to help you stay alive during those few dangerous seconds when your ultimate runs out.</p>
<h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>
<p>This is a rare build where you need a specific weapon for the build to truely shine, and unfortunately the weapon required was a limited event. It is currently impossible to get another one of these unless there is a rerun or  you did the event but still have unused tickets for it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upananda [UR] (Snake event only weapon)</li>
<li>Sub can be anything that gives you the most stats</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In the end Su is a very fun character to play as. She may not be very beginner friendly due to her unique dodge and ultimate mechanics but she will offer something interesting and new for existing players to change things up. She has very solid aoe clearing builds that make most hard content a breeze. Her unique ultimate opens up new opprotunities to take on very difficult content like tower arena and she’s already proven herself to be able to clear the very difficult top floors with it. She can be considered a niche character due to this but her other builds carry their weight for the majority of content in this game.</p>
