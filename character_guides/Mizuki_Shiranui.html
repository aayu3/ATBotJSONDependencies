<p>Hello and welcome to my basic guide on Mizuki Shiranui!</p>
<p>For those who might be returning from the ancient times, Shiranui has received a series of buffs when the Japanese and Global servers merged. She is no longer the slow and undertuned Shiranui you knew before.</p>
<p>Shiranui has scaled towards the top of the pyramid. She deals an incredible amount of damage and now has the attack speed to match!</p>

<h3 id="recommended-supporters">Recommended Supporters</h3>
<p>I have recommended a couple Supporter loadouts that should serve you well in all content. For a more comprehensive list of effective Supporter loadouts, I would suggest checking out my <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/17e5IxmKQ0tpCvhTT9l0VAfidnvGdxAEfGMtDsMRiQmk/htmlview#">Mizuki Shiranui build guidelines.</a></strong></p>

<p>Ingrid synergizes well with powerful Weapon Skill effects (Cocytus, Dawn of the Punisher) or if you would simply like to use your Ultimate more often.</p>

<h3 id="taimanin-art-water-flow">Taimanin Art: Water Flow</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Z1bNlcT" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Put simply, Taimanin Art: Water Flow is a passive damage increase to your normal attack damage and Particle generation.</p>
<p>There are a few players who continue to frown upon Shiranui’s normal attack wind up when she begins each sequence. I recommend ensuring there is enough distance between you and your target. Shiranui’s effective range is a bit greater than the length of her Naginata.</p>
<p>After Shiranui’s recent buffs, it has becomes even more difficult to consider substituting Taimanin Art: Water Flow for any other skill. Nevertheless, Shiranui does possess a powerful skillset that one could comfortably substitute her Taimanin Art for an alternative skill if they ever wished to do so.</p>
<h3 id="sougetsuin-a">Sougetsuin [A]</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wf4mEnn" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Sougetsuin adapts to the type of Main Supporter you have enlisted. If you lead with an Assist Supporter, you will gain a 15% movement and attack speed buff for 10 seconds. If you lead with a Suppress Supporter, you will gain a 20% Critical Chance increase for 10 seconds. Both of the stat buffs are incredibly powerful and worthy of consideration. The most important decision to make when fielding a full Assist Supporter loadout is, “Should I take Sougetsuin or Yuugengoku?”</p>
<p>In all honesty, I rotate between the two depending on the challenge ahead. If my DPS uptime is low, I will take Yuugengoku. If my DPS uptime is high, I will take Sougetsuin. Sougetsuin is also a powerful choice if the need to kite your opposition ever arises.</p>
<p>Sougetsuin has a <strong>9.1</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="yuugengoku-a">Yuugengoku [A]</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8b9wKE3" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>In any case, Yuugengoku is both a high damage and wide area-of-effect skill on a short cooldown—an extremely short cooldown. The only fault Yuugengoku has is that it shares an input activation with Sougetsuin.</p>
<p>See Sougetsuin for additional thoughts on taking Sougetsuin or Yuugengoku.</p>
<p>Yuugengoku has a <strong>9.8</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<p>Yuugengoku has a <strong>7</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25 and its Set 2 bonus is active.</p>
<h3 id="shinenshinshoku-b">ShinenShinshoku [B]</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rsIxiZ7" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>ShinenShinshoku is one of the two extreme dodges Shiranui has available to her. ShinenShinshoku deals consistent and reliable damage to every enemy within its range for a few seconds. By default, this skill affects those within a relatively wide range thus devaluing the the Set 2 bonus gained with two Protect Supporters equipped. Conversely, the Set 2 bonus for both Assist and Suppress Supporters are both a net gain towards your total DPS.</p>
<p>As was the case between Sougetsuin and Yuugengoku, you must also decide between ShinenShinshoku and Geneijin. Each has its place but I feel that your Supporters and weapons may influence your choice!</p>
<p>ShinenShinshoku has a <strong>6.3</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="geneijin-b">Geneijin [B]</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7O5p3HV" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>In addition to serving as an extreme dodge, Geneijin is a unique skill that summons a Water Clone to fight alongside you for 10 seconds. The Set 2 effect with two Assist Supporters equipped increases their time on the field. This allows some Assist Supporter builds to field a maximum of three Water Clones at once (conditions must be met). The Set 2 effect with two Suppress Supporters is fairly straightforward as it is a +50% damage gain for your Water Clones.</p>
<p>Geneijin gains increased value when [Apostle] Mizuki Shiranui is equipped in the Main Supporter slot.</p>
<p>Geneijin gains increased value when the weapon “Dawn of the Punisher” is your active weapon.</p>
<p>Geneijin has a <strong>9.8</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="rondo-c">Rondo [C]</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/m6cOceu" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Rondo is Shiranui’s Awakened Skill. Of the few I have, this is my favorite option. This skill deals a high damage in a large area-of-effect around Shiranui. Each of the Set 2 bonuses have their place. When fielding two Assist Supporters, Shiranui gains +20% movement and attack speed for 10 seconds. When fielding two Protect Supporters, Shiranui reduces damage taken by 20% for 10 seconds. When fielding two Suppress Supporters, Shiranui is able to heal herself for 5% of the damage that Rondo dealt (for reference, 5% of 300,000 is 15,000 HP healed).</p>
<p>Rondo shares an activation input with Senkou. This means nothing to an Assist Supporter build. For Suppress Supporters, I favor Rondo’s large area-of-effect but often find myself using Senkou for its high single-target damage. Both Skills offer Shiranui powerful sustain options. While making your decision, keep your target content in mind.</p>
<p>Rondo has a <strong>7.7</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="senkou-c">Senkou [C]</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qaFvHNh" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Senkou is a lethal charge that deals high single-target damage. Each Set bonus effect is worth taking and makes Shiranui’s triple Suppress Supporter loadouts even more appealing. Set 1 grants Shiranui a self-heal option. Set 2 adds a second damaging effect to the skill. The piercing charge portion is governed by “melee” damaging effects while the Set 2 water illusion is governed by “range” damaging effects. Set 3 grants you Mama-levels of  critical damage.</p>
<p>Senkou has a <strong>10.5</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="kaza-guruma">Kaza guruma</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/k9XuY4d" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>At the risk of leaving Shiranui exposed, Kaza guruma deals a high amount of damage while receiving all of the style points. I admit this is a rathe niche skill but it will find its place!</p>
<p>Kaza guruma is strong option to consider when building a Suppress/Protect Supporter hybrid build. If such a build leads with a Suppress Supporter and equips Sougetsuin, Kaza guruma can reach nearly 100% critical chance (if Supporter Formations and Awakened Skills permit).</p>
<p>Kaza guruma has an <strong>11.9</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="genei-sekai">Genei Sekai</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/SgQQh3o" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Genei Sekai is Shiranui’s counter. By default, it applies a Stun effect on its target if any of the three Set 3 requirements are met. If Shiranui is part of your Battle Arena team and you can optimize her with a satisfactory Suppress Supporter loadout, Genei Sekai’s value skyrockets.</p>
<p>Genei Sekai has an <strong>4.9</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<p>Genei Sekai has an <strong>2.8</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25 and three Suppress Supporters are equipped.</p>
<h3 id="rakka-ryuusui">Rakka Ryuusui</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2e7Gmne" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>This is Shiranui’s launcher. I find that I have trouble incorporating any launcher in PVE content and believe they are best served in the Battle Arena.</p>
<p>Rakka Ryuusui has a <strong>8.4</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<p>Genei Sekai has an <strong>4.9</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25 and its Set 1 bonus is active.</p>
<h1 id="builds">Builds</h1>
<p>The most important aspect of any build is finding one that works for <em>you</em>. Due to the inherent nature of gacha games, every Action Taimanin account is unique! Every player has their own approach the game and their character of choice. I ask for your understanding that the builds I share with you may drastically change based on your own playstyle. What has worked for me may not work for you and I will endeavor to continue limit testing each build as I share them. These builds are highly subjective and are representative of my own opinions, experiences, and general theorycrafting. For the complete showcase of all my Shiranui builds, you can find them on my <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/17e5IxmKQ0tpCvhTT9l0VAfidnvGdxAEfGMtDsMRiQmk/htmlview#">Mizuki Shiranui build guidelines here.</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="beginner-build">Beginner Build</h2>
<p>Shiranui’s [R]R|R build serves as a great introduction to Shiranui and is extremely forgiving. Senkou and Rondo provide her two powerful options for self-healing! This build will serve both beginners and veterans well!</p>
<h3 id="supports">Supports</h3>
<ul>
<li>[Main] Kuonji R. Spica<br>
[Sub] Sanada Homura<br>
[Sub] Shido Rinka<br>
[Optional] Ingrid</li>
</ul>
<p>Ingrid’s value skyrockets when you have Cocytus or Dawn of the Punisher (or if you prefer access to your Ultimate sooner). Shido Rinka and Ingrid are interchangeable.</p>
<p>Rotate your Main Supporter based on the difficulty of the content. Sanada Homura is great for speed runs while Kuonji R. Spica’s invulnerability is priceless in the face of danger!</p>
<h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>
<ul>
<li>[Main] Cocytus (0.05% UR Weapon Gacha)</li>
<li>[Main] Dawn of the Punisher (0.05% UR Weapon Gacha)</li>
<li>[Sub] Amber/Crimson/Viridian Naginata (10,000 Arena Points)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an SL5 UR Gacha Weapon, you’re going to want to use it. Cocytus’ Weapon Skill can be cast at the cost of only 3 Particles. Dawn of the Punisher may lack on-demand burst damage but it more than makes up for it with a flat damage buff and a powerful passive effect!</p>
<h3 id="skills-1">Skills</h3>
<ol>
<li>Taimanin Art: Water Flow</li>
<li>Sougetsuin</li>
<li>Rondo or Senkou</li>
<li>ShinenShinshoku</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of these skills are interchangeable if you find that you want to run an extreme dodge. Perhaps your playstyle calls for more Skill usage than normal attack swings or vice-versa. The choice is yours!</p>
<h2 id="critical-chance-and-critical-damage-build">Critical Chance and Critical Damage Build</h2>

<ol>
<li>Taimanin Art: Water Flow or Rondo</li>
<li>Yuugengoku or Sougetsuin</li>
<li>ShinenShinshoku or Genijin</li>
</ol>
<p>While Fujibayashi Yuno leads your Supporter loadout, Taimanin Art: Water Flow is a must have. For each of the other options, it remains completely optional. Shiranui’s effectiveness fluctuates and is determined by each person’s playstyle.</p>
<p>Yuugengoku offers incredible burst damage while Sougetsuin provides a potent attack speed buff.</p>
<p>While [Apostle] Mizuki Shiranui leads your Supporter loadout, a rather unique opportunity presents itself—Triple Water Clones! By equipping Geneijin, extreme dodging twice for two active Water Clones, and then activating <em>Water Art: Phantom Summoning</em>, you may now enjoy a total of three active Water Clones! This is even more satisfying with Dawn of the Punisher.</p>
<h2 id="hybrid-build">Hybrid Build</h2>
<p>This purpose behind this build is to make the most out of Sougetsuin’s +20% Critical Chance buff and, if you would like, Rondo’s +20% movement and attack speed buff.</p>
