<p>Hello and welcome to my basic guide on Koukawa Asuka! If you’re here, you’re already well on your way to making the best possible decision you can in Action Taimanin and that is by playing Asuka!</p>
<p>On a more serious note, Asuka may not be for you. While she is extremely versatile being capable of adapting to any Supporter loadout, she does come with one major drawback—she has <em><strong>zero</strong></em> sustain. Asuka is unable to heal herself with her base kit. What she lacks in healing, she more than makes up in raw power! I firmly believe that every character should have access to some form of sustain option. Feel free to make your voice heard by offering your own opinions or requests to the Action Taimanin team <strong><a href="https://www.actiontaimanin.net/inquiry/en">here!</a></strong></p>

<p>Koukawa Asuka is among the most versatile playable characters available in Action Taimanin. Below, you will find that I have recommended three Supporter loadouts that will serve you well in all content. For a more comprehensive list of effective Supporter loadouts, I would suggest checking out my <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/17e5IxmKQ0tpCvhTT9l0VAfidnvGdxAEfGMtDsMRiQmk/htmlview#">Koukawa Asuka build guidelines.</a></strong></p>

<h3 id="taimanin-art-wind-god">Taimanin Art: Wind God</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JBSmGcm" alt="Taimanin Art: Wind God"></p>
<p>Taimanin Art: Wind God adds piercing projectiles to Asuka’s normal attacks. With each swing of her normal attack, she now releases a wind slash in a straight line. This wind slash deals damage to every enemy it hits. The addition of these wind slashes converts her previously “melee” normal attacks into “ranged” ones. While Taimanin Art: Wind God is equipped, Asuka’s normal attacks no longer benefit from <em>any</em> effects that strictly indicate “melee.” Instead, her normal attacks are now governed by effects detailing “ranged.”</p>
<h3 id="wind-god-slicer-zone">Wind God: Slicer Zone</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ubP1AW4" alt="Wind God: Slicer Zone"></p>
<p>This is Asuka’s extreme dodge and it is a unique one! After successfully triggering Wind God: Slicer Zone, Asuka surrounds herself with a series of wind blades that deal a respectable amount of damage. Each of the three Set 2 bonuses are viable and I encourage you to try each of the them out.</p>
<p>Wind God: Slicer Zone has a <strong>10.5</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="dust-cyclone-a">Dust Cyclone (A)</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OlY2mio" alt="Dust Cyclone (A)"></p>
<p>Dust Cyclone’s effect adapts to the Supporter placed in your Main Supporter slot — <em>Assist, Suppress,</em> or <em>Protect.</em> Each of the three effects is extraordinarily powerful and it is thanks largely in part to this that Asuka is able to flourish with any number of Supporter loadouts! You can rest assured that Dust Cyclone will provide you with a satisfactory stat buff for your unique playstyle.</p>
<p>Dust Cyclone has a <strong>9.8</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="mach-impact-a">Mach Impact (A)</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wEPu32s" alt="Mach Impact (A)"></p>
<p>If, for any reason, you find Dust Cyclone lacking, you may substitute Mach Impact in its place. In order to maximize its damage, Mach Impact demands that you enlist three Assist Supporters to enable to each of its Set bonuses.</p>
<p>Mach Impact deals area-of-effect damage in two parts—one explosion per swing! It is an incredibly powerful skill for clearing groups or dealing burst damage to a single target.</p>
<p>Mach Impact has a <strong>9.1</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="rending-storm">Rending Storm</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/s1qEFsb" alt="Rending Storm"></p>
<p>Rending Storm is one of Asuka’s highest damage dealing skills. Each Set bonus increases its value and warrants consideration for any hybrid Supporter loadout. By default, Rending Storm boasts some high base damage. When this damage is further amplified by Rending Storm’s Set 3 bonus, you should expect to one-shot most trash mobs or deal a significant portion of any boss’ health pool. The mobility afforded to you by taking Rending Storm is also worthy of praise or scorn depending on your platform!</p>
<p>Rending Storm has a <strong>12.6</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="mach-punch-b">Mach Punch (B)</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Aa3JrEf" alt="Mach Punch (B)"></p>
<p>Similar to Mach Impact, Mach Punch is another one of Asuka’s skills that deal damage in an area-of-effect. The most appealing aspect of Mach Punch is the crowd control (groggy) that it can apply when its Set 2 bonus is active. The Set 3 bonus almost always guarantees that Mach Punch will deal critical damage.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Mach Punch is viable in hybrid builds that lead with a Suppress Supporter and with the Dust Cyclone skill equipped. The addition of Awakened Skills and Supporter Formations allow for us to reach and surpass 100% critical chance while Dust Cyclone is active.</p>
<p>Mach Punch has a <strong>14</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="soaring-dance">Soaring Dance</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OwpIYlQ" alt="Soaring Dance"></p>
<p>Soaring Dance is your typical “launcher” and will be one of the more powerful options to consider if you are fielding Asuka as part of your Battle Arena team. Skills such as these have niche uses in PVE content.</p>
<p>Soaring Dance has a <strong>10.5</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<p>Soaring Dance has a <strong>7.5</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25 and its Set 1 effect is active.</p>
<h3 id="spiral-blast">Spiral Blast</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vMTG7E4" alt="Spiral Blast"></p>
<p>Spiral Blast is Asuka’s counter. I would generally advise against its usage in PVE because it requires you to incur damage. Asuka, sadly, does not have any access to super armor nor self-heals. It is extremely unforgiving for her to receive any amount of damage.</p>
<p>Spiral Blast has a <strong>5.6</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="kill-em-all-missiles">Kill-Em-All Missiles</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/isAE3i1" alt="Kill-Em-All Missiles"></p>
<p>Kill-Em-All Missiles is a flavorful and very niche skill. The Set 3 bonus effect from enlisting three Assist Supporters applies a debuff to the targets hit and allows for you to deal additional damage. The Set 3 bonus effect from enlisting three Suppress Supporters is simply a knockback that can be fired from ranged. The utility gained is worth consideration for times where you cannot overpower your opposition.</p>
<p>Kill-Em-All Missiles has an <strong>11.2</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h3 id="bomb-escape-b">Bomb Escape (B)</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XlWziRe" alt="Bomb Escape (B)"></p>
<p>Bomb Escape is Asuka’s Awakened Skill. This skill deals a moderate amount of damage in an area-of-effect surrounding Asuka while she evades backwards. It is unfortunate but while evading backwards, Asuka also begins a slow descent back towards the ground effectively applying a self-crowd control to her own self.</p>
<p>Bomb Escape has an <strong>11.9</strong> second cooldown when “Upgrade Cooldown” is at LV.25.</p>
<h1 id="builds">Builds</h1>
<p>The most important aspect of any build is finding one that works for <em>you</em>. Due to the inherent nature of gacha games, every Action Taimanin account is unique! Every player has their own approach the game and their character of choice. I ask for your understanding that the builds I share with you may drastically change based on your own playstyle. What has worked for me may not work for you and I will endeavor to continue limit testing each build as I share them. These builds are highly subjective and are representative of my own opinions, experiences, and general theorycrafting. For the complete showcase of all my Asuka builds, you can find them on my <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/17e5IxmKQ0tpCvhTT9l0VAfidnvGdxAEfGMtDsMRiQmk/htmlview#">Koukawa Asuka build guidelines here.</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="beginner-build">Beginner Build</h2>
<p>I consider the classic [R]R|R build to be the best introduction to Asuka. This build is fairly straightforward and will serve both beginners and veterans well!</p>

<p>Dust Cyclone and Mach Impact share the same input command and are interchangeable. Mach Impact deals a significant amount of damage with this build and is very much worth your consideration!</p>
<h2 id="hybrid-build">Hybrid Build</h2>
<p>This purpose behind this build is to make the most out of Dust Cyclone’s +20% Critical Chance buff.</p>
<h3 id="supports-2">Supports</h3>

<ol>
<li>Taimanin Art: Wind God</li>
<li>Dust Cyclone</li>
<li>Wind God: Slicer Zone</li>
</ol>
<p>By leading this build with a Suppress Supporter in its Main Slot, Dust Cyclone’s buffed stat will be +20% Critical Chance for 10 seconds. Tekkain Kaworu and Sakuragi Surug are the best two Critical Chance and/or Critical Damage Supporters to help you reach critical chance cap. This is made easier with the addition of Awakened Skills and the Supporter Formation bonuses. With or without these perks, you expect some high DPS with this loadout.</p>
<h2 id="battle-arena-build-pvp">Battle Arena Build (PVP)</h2>
<p>Mekaura Uraru is not available to to the Global playerbase at this time. There are many viable Protect Supporters who can act as temporary substitutes. I consider Mach Punch and Spiral Blast to be interchangeable depending on your current placement and ranking.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Koukawa Asuka is certainly unique case! She is a character who performs well with every Supporter loadout that does not explicitly dictate “melee” or “ranged.” Many of her skills offer her enough flexibility to accommodate any player’s specific need. Conversely, Asuka continues to be plagued by one major con and is unable to passively heal or apply any sort of super armor from her base kit. In order to access these tools, she must forfeit a a large portion of her damage dealing capabilities. Don’t let that stop you, though! Asuka is both powerful and mobile enough to make up for any of her shortcomings and come out on top and unscathed!</p>
