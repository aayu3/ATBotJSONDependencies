                <p>
                  This is a basic reroll guide for Action Taimanin. Rerolling in this game isn't particularly important as the game is very F2P friendly and you can roll discount gacha fairly often.
                  The main goal of rerolling is to get supporters, weapons are less important unless you plan to whale, as an SLVL 5 Arena or Event weapon will be far better than an SLVL 1-2 Gacha UR weapon.
                  We also won't be covering Limited Gacha, as the supporters can be a hit or miss, for example <a href="supporters_html/0045.html" target="_target">Rinko</a> and <a href="supporters_html/0042.html" target="_target">Murasaki</a>
                   were quite good, while <a href="supporters_html/0056.html" target="_target">Kirara</a> is a bit lackluster in comparison. It is best to reroll when there is a limited banner though, or multiple gachas, since you finish the tutorial with 500 gems, which is enough for 2 discount rolls, other wise you will need to clear some levels to get up to 600 gems for two rolls of the same gacha.
                   If you are rerolling and have questions about the limited gacha, feel free to ask in the discord. 
                </p>
                <h2 id="supporter"><u>Supporters</u></h2>
                <p>We will only be covering supporters currently avalible in the Standard Gacha, and from an F2P players point of view, 
                  this means we will assume you only get 1 copy for the SLvl for passive skills. Below we have a brief tierlist, as well as more descriptive information for each supporter.</p>

Unfortunately, this only really works with Emily, and Hisui is only really useful if you plan to get Emily. In addition, other just passive damage boosters tend to be better.</p>

She has an extremely good passive, just giving additional damage against Demons and Humans. Her lead skill is also quite good on a decent cooldown. The main utility is disarming which prevents the opponent from attacking for up to 8 seconds, providing a pseudo-invulnerability. Her main shortcoming is the short-mediumish range of the attack</p>

Because of how common Emily is in Arena, having at least one Major is usually a must have. Major also synergizes well with Kurenai since her Deflecting Wind skill needs a red lead. Finally, Major can be used in PvE to delete bosses, but the targeting on skill can be a bit random. Major isn't too important to look for though, since you can get her from the rank 10 UR choice ticket.</p>

She provides 14 seconds on invulnerability on the lowest 49 seconds cooldown in the game. She can be used with cooldown supporters to often cheese difficult PvE content. Her skill also is guaranteed to hit every enemy in the room for a decent chunk of damage, and can even hit enemies that spawn in after the skill has been used. Her passive buffs both melee and ranged attacks as well.</p>

The only reason she doesn't make it into the top tier is because Homura is an SR, and therefore not as important when rerolling as some URs.</p>
